### Requirements

#### Requirements for UML files visualisation

- UML files were created using the free tool Visual Paradigm Community Edition [[Link]](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp)  
- The full Visual Paradigm project can be found in `/uml/vpproject`.  
- To visualise the UML diagrams in the webpage report download `/uml/webpage` folder and run index.html.  
- The exported files are located in `/uml/exported_uml_files`. We have created a few of them, considered by us as the most representative 
  of the worked developed in this project.  

We decided to use this software as it was way more user friendly and more intuitive to use.

## Progress so far:

Every functionality is running now.  
UML diagrams integrated.  
Test cases created.  

## General information

Every test case can be identified by a "Test" suffix in the source files.  
Source code can be found in `src/ucd/the/game/of/life`.

## TODO

Enjoy the holidays :-)
To be continued...
